<h1>Iter8or.io</h1>

During my summer internship with General Dynamics Information Technology, I was tasked with building a fill stack appliaction is roughly 5-6 weeks. 
The goal of this app was for the Federal Aviation Administration development team to have software that documents team members' opinions and ideas after each agile
scrum sprint. The code for the app itself is inded confidential due to GDIT policies, but I will share demos with dummy data for visual representation.

With limited time, my manager requested that I user PHP for my backend API because of its simplicity, and jQuery got it's Ajax capabilities. I also used
Bootstrap, SASS, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Chart.js to aid in development.

Key Functionality: A visual sprint board with user-created cards that auto populate every few seconds. all cards are divided across 4 seperate lanes (Loved, Loathed, Learned, Longed).
Each card is clickable, triggering a modal constining all of that card's information. 

Extra Functionality: User analytics (tracking actions of each user in order to develop a point system), feedback center, and a poll system.
